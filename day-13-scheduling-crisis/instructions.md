# Day 13: Festival Scheduling Crisis

## Instructions

For this challenge, help Marcus build a real scheduling system. Take the notes and build an HTML website with the schedule. The website should include:

- Organized staff information (who can work when and where)
- Clear scheduling conflicts identified (problems spotted before they happen)
- Complete 3-day festival schedule (everyone knows their assignments)
- Professional scheduling website (no more napkin schedules!)
