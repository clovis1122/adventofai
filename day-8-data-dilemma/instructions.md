# Day 8: Dmitry's Data Dilemma

## Instructions
Read the vendor list at `.data/`, clean up the vendor names (First letter capitalized, rest lowercase, no redundant ! or &, add missing apostrophes). Include location and cuisine.

The output must be a JSON file with the vendor's data. Save this at the `output/` folder. Use the same name as the file, but with json extension.
