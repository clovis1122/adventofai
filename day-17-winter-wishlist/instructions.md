# Day 17: Winter Wishlist

## Instructions
Build the Winter Fairy's digital wishbox using MCP UI - a way to render beautiful visual interfaces directly inside the chat.

Make a Wish 🌟

Tell goose something like: "I wish for warm mittens" or "Add 'snow on Christmas' to my wishbox"
Each wish has: the wish itself, category (toy/experience/kindness/magic), and how much they want it (dream wish/hopeful wish/small wish)
The updated wishbox UI appears showing your new wish!
View Your Wishes ✨

Ask goose: "Show me my wishes" or "What's in my wishbox?"
A beautiful, magical UI renders displaying all your wishes
Wishes are styled by how much you want them (dream wishes glow brighter!)
Grant a Wish 🧚

Tell goose: "My mittens wish came true!" or "Grant the snow wish"
The UI re-renders with that wish sparkling as granted ✨
Release a Wish 🍃

Tell goose: "Remove the mittens wish" or "Let go of my first wish"
The wishbox UI updates without that wish
Works in goose 🪿

Your MCP server runs locally
Every time you talk to goose about your wishes, the UI magically appears
