# Day 12: Council crisis

## Instructions

As the festival director, use the council of mine MCP to get nine different perspectives, debate, and make a decision about which mascot to use for the winter festival. Here's how the debate went so far:

- The Marketing Director wants a snowman ⛄ (Classic! Recognizable! Easy to make costumes!)
- The Entertainment Coordinator wants a penguin 🐧 (Cute! Marketable! Kids love penguins!)
- The Volunteer Manager wants a polar bear 🐻‍❄️ (Majestic! Powerful! Represents strength!)
- The Artistic Director wants a magical ice fairy 🧚 (Whimsical! Unique! Instagram-worthy!)
- The Local Historian wants a friendly yeti 🦣 (Mysterious! Fun! Tells a story!)

The council of mine should debate, vote democratically, and select the winner mascot.
