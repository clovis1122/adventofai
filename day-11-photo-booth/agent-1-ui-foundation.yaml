description: Build the HTML structure and user interface for the photo booth app

prompt: |
  You are building the UI foundation for a Winter Festival Photo Booth web app.
  
  ## Your Responsibilities
  
  Create a single-page HTML application with the following:
  
  ### HTML Structure
  - Create index.html with embedded CSS and minimal JS scaffolding
  - Video element for camera preview (id="videoFeed")
  - Canvas element for filter overlay (id="filterCanvas")
  - Hidden canvas for photo capture (id="captureCanvas")
  
  ### User Interface Elements
  - Title: "Winter Festival Photo Booth"
  - Filter selector dropdown with options:
    * No Filter
    * Snowflake Crown
    * Reindeer Antlers
    * Frosty Beard
  - "Capture Photo" button (large, prominent)
  - "Download" button (hidden initially, shown after capture)
  - Instructions text: "Select a filter and smile!"
  
  ### Styling Requirements
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Video/canvas should fill available screen width (max 640px)
  - Festive winter theme: blues, whites, sparkles
  - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
  - Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px height)
  - Dark background to reduce eye strain
  
  ### JavaScript Scaffolding
  Provide placeholder functions (empty implementations - Agent 2 will fill these):
  - `initCamera()` - will initialize camera access
  - `startFaceDetection()` - will start face tracking
  - `applyFilter(filterName)` - will render selected filter
  - `capturePhoto()` - will save current frame
  - `downloadPhoto()` - will trigger download
  
  Set up event listeners:
  - Filter dropdown onChange → call applyFilter()
  - Capture button onClick → call capturePhoto()
  - Download button onClick → call downloadPhoto()
  
  ### Integration Points for Agent 2
  Document clearly in code comments:
  - Where camera initialization should happen (DOMContentLoaded)
  - Canvas sizing should match video dimensions
  - Filter canvas should overlay video perfectly (position: absolute)
  
  ## Deliverables
  
  1. Complete index.html file
  2. Inline CSS for all styling
  3. JavaScript structure with placeholder functions
  4. Code comments explaining integration points
  5. Brief README section explaining the UI structure
  
  ## Constraints
  
  - Single HTML file (no separate CSS/JS files)
  - No external frameworks (vanilla JS, CSS, HTML only)
  - Must work on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
  - Assume HTTPS (required for camera access)
  
  ## Success Criteria
  
  - File opens and displays UI correctly
  - All buttons and dropdowns are functional (even if placeholders)
  - Responsive layout works on mobile (320px) to desktop (1920px)
  - Code is well-commented for Agent 2 to understand integration points
  - Professional, festive appearance
