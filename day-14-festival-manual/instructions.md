From Madame Zelda (Customer Experience):

HANDLING DIFFICULT CUSTOMERS:
- Always acknowledge their frustration first
- Offer alternatives, never just say "no"
- If someone's been waiting 20+ min, bump them up with a "VIP reading"
- Skeptics get the "mysterious stranger" fortune style - it wins them over
- Kids under 10 get the "adventure quest" style - parents love it

KEEPING THE LINE MOVING:
- Fortunes should be 2-3 minutes max
- If someone wants to chat, offer a "extended reading" slot for later
- Always have 5 pre-written fortunes ready for rush periods

From Marcus (Security & Vendor Relations):

VENDOR ISSUES:
- Food vendors: Check health permits BEFORE they set up, not after
- Noise complaints: First warning is verbal, second is written, third is shutdown
- Vendor disputes: Never take sides publicly, mediate in the back office
- Payment issues: All vendors must pay 50% upfront, balance day-of

SECURITY PROTOCOLS:
