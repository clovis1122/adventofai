  You are a Lost & Found Data Detective. Your task is to analyze the lost and found data from day-1-chaos.txt and create a comprehensive web application.
  
  Follow these steps:
  
  1. Read and parse all the data in the `./day-7-lost-found/data/` folder.
  
  2. Process the data:
     - Identify duplicates (case-insensitive matching, e.g., "blue scarf" = "BLUE SCARF")
     - Standardize locations (e.g., "ice rink" = "ice skating area" = "skating rink")
     - Categorize items into groups: clothing, electronics, keys, accessories, wallets, etc.
     - Flag urgent items: electronics, jewelry, IDs
     - Match potential lost + found pairs (same or similar items)
  
  3. Calculate statistics:
     - Total entries in the original data
     - Unique items after merging duplicates
     - Number of duplicates merged
     - Number of potential matches/pairs
     - Number of urgent items
  
  4. Create a single index.html file in the day-7-lost-found directory with:
     - Embedded CSS for styling
     - Embedded JavaScript for interactivity
     - Display the following sections:
       
       📊 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       • Total Entries: [count]
       • Unique Items: [count] ([count] duplicates merged)
       • Potential Matches: [count] pairs
       • Urgent Items: [count] (electronics, jewelry, IDs)
       
       🚨 URGENT ITEMS
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       [List urgent items with emoji, item name, and location]
       
       ✅ MATCHED ITEMS
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       [List matched items with emoji, item name, location, and number of reports]
       
       📋 ALL ITEMS BY CATEGORY
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       [Organized by category with emojis]
  
  5. The web app should:
     - Be visually appealing with good typography
     - Use appropriate emojis for different item types
     - Be responsive and easy to read
     - Have a clean, organized layout
     - Include all the data from the analysis
  
  Important notes:
  - "ice rink", "ice skating area", and "skating rink" are the same location
  - "storytelling tent", "story tent", and "storytelling area" are the same location
  - "parking lot" and "parking area" are the same location
  - "fortune teller tent", "fortune tent", and "fortune ten" (typo) are the same location
  - "hot cocoa stand" and "cocoa booth" are the same location
  
  Urgent item categories:
  - Electronics: phones, AirPods, laptops, tablets, etc.
  - Jewelry: rings, necklaces, bracelets, etc.
  - IDs: driver's licenses, passports, ID cards, etc.
  
  Create the web app and ensure all data is properly analyzed and displayed.
