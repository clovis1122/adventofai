  2. Twitter/X Thread - 3-5 tweet thread building excitement

  ## Your Task: Compile Campaign Summary

  Review the outputs by the sub-recipes and create a comprehensive campaign document that includes:

     - Target audience analysis
     - Campaign objectives
     - Publishing schedule recommendations

  2. **Instagram Content Section**
     - Display the complete Instagram post generated by the sub-recipe
     - Best posting times recommendation (typically 11 AM - 1 PM or 7 PM - 9 PM)
     - Engagement tactics (Stories, Reels follow-up ideas)

  3. **Twitter/X Content Section**
     - Display the complete Twitter thread generated by the sub-recipe
     - Threading tips (post tweets 1-2 minutes apart)
     - Engagement tactics (polls, questions to audience)

  4. **Facebook Content Section**
     - Display the complete Facebook event description generated by the sub-recipe
     - Event setup tips (cover image, location, ticket link)
     - Promotion strategies (boosted posts, event shares)

  5. **Cross-Platform Strategy**

     - Content adaptation notes
     - Unified hashtag strategy across platforms
     - Timing recommendations (stagger posts by 1-2 hours)
     - Engagement monitoring tips

  6. **Next Steps Checklist**
     - Pre-launch checklist
     - Performance metrics to track (engagement rate, ticket link clicks, shares)
     - Follow-up content ideas

  ## Output Format
  
  Save the campaign document as an HTML file named `index.html`
  
  Create a beautiful, professional HTML document with:
  - Modern, clean CSS styling with a professional color scheme (gradients, shadows, cards)
  - Responsive design that works on all devices
  - Clear section headers with visual hierarchy
  - Content cards for each platform with platform branding colors:
    * Instagram: Purple/pink gradient (#833AB4 to #E1306C)
    * Twitter/X: Black (#000000) or dark gray
    * Facebook: Blue (#1877F2)
  - **Copy-to-clipboard buttons with JavaScript functionality**
  - Tables for schedules or metrics where appropriate
  - Print-friendly styles
  - Professional typography (modern sans-serif fonts)
  - Icons or emojis for visual appeal
  
  The HTML should include:
  - A hero header with "{{ event_name }} - Social Media Campaign"
  - Event details (date, audience, CTA) in a prominent badge
  - Three main platform cards (Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook)
  - Each card must have:
    * Platform-colored header with icon/emoji
    * The complete generated social media content in a textarea or pre-formatted box
    * "Copy to Clipboard" button that works with JavaScript
    * Platform-specific tips and best practices
  - Cross-platform strategy section
  - Interactive checklist with checkboxes
  - Footer with generation timestamp
  
  **IMPORTANT**: Include inline JavaScript for copy-to-clipboard functionality.
  Make it visually stunning and production-ready.
  All CSS and JavaScript must be inline for single-file portability.
