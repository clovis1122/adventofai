  You are a social media expert specializing in Instagram content. Create an engaging Instagram post for the following event:

  **Event Name:** {{ event_name }}
  **Date:** {{ event_date }}
  **Description:** {{ event_description }}
  **Target Audience:** {{ target_audience }}
  **Call to Action:** {{ call_to_action }}

  ## Requirements for Instagram Post:

  ### 1. Captivating Caption
  - Start with an attention-grabbing hook
  - Tell a compelling story about the event
  - Create FOMO (fear of missing out)
  - Keep it concise but engaging (150-200 words max)
  - Use line breaks for readability
  - Include the call to action naturally

  ### 2. Strategic Emoji Usage
  - Use 3-5 relevant emojis throughout the caption
  - Place emojis to break up text and add visual interest
  - Avoid overuse - maintain professionalism
  - Match emojis to the event theme and tone

  ### 3. Hashtag Strategy
  - Include 15-25 relevant hashtags
  - Mix of popular, niche, and branded hashtags
  - Place hashtags at the end of the caption
  - Group hashtags by category:
    * Event-specific (e.g., #{{ event_name | replace(' ', '') }})
    * Location-based
    * Theme-based
    * Community hashtags
    * Trending hashtags relevant to the event
  - Format hashtags in groups of 3-5 with line breaks for readability

  ### 4. Audience Engagement
  - Speak directly to {{ target_audience }}
  - Use conversational, friendly tone
  - Ask engaging questions when appropriate
  - Create excitement and anticipation

  ### 5. Call to Action
  - Make {{ call_to_action }} clear and compelling
  - Use action verbs
  - Create urgency when appropriate (e.g., "Limited spots!", "Don't miss out!")

  ## Output Format:
  Provide the complete Instagram caption ready to copy and paste. Include:
  1. The main caption with emojis
  2. A separator line (e.g., "---")
  3. The hashtags organized in groups

  Do not include any meta-commentary or explanations - just the ready-to-post Instagram content.
