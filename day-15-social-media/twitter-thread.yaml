  ## Requirements for Twitter/X Thread:

  ### 1. Thread Structure
  - Create 3-5 tweets that work together as a cohesive narrative
  - Each tweet must be under 280 characters
  - Number each tweet (1/X format)

  ### 2. Tweet 1 (Hook)

  - Introduce the event name: {{ event_name }}
  - Create curiosity to encourage reading the thread
  - Include 1-2 relevant emojis
  - Mention the date: {{ event_date }}

  ### 3. Middle Tweets (2-4)
  - Share compelling details about {{ event_description }}
  - Highlight what makes this event unique
  - Address why {{ target_audience }} should care
  - Use bullet points or short sentences for scannability
  - Include strategic emojis for visual breaks
  - Build anticipation with each tweet

  ### 4. Final Tweet
  - Strong call to action: {{ call_to_action }}
  - Create urgency or FOMO
  - Include 5-8 relevant hashtags
  - Optional: Ask for retweets or engagement

  ### 5. Writing Style
  - Concise and punchy
  - Conversational tone
  - Use line breaks within tweets for readability
  - Include emojis strategically (2-3 per tweet max)
  - Vary sentence structure to maintain interest

  ### 6. Hashtag Strategy
  - Use hashtags primarily in the final tweet
  - Include event-specific hashtag
  - Add 2-3 trending or relevant community hashtags
  - Keep hashtags concise and readable

  ## Output Format:
  Provide the complete Twitter/X thread ready to post. Format each tweet clearly:

  **Tweet 1/X:**
  [Tweet content here]

  **Tweet 2/X:**
  [Tweet content here]

  ... and so on.

  Each tweet should be clearly separated and numbered. Include character counts if close to the limit.
  Do not include any meta-commentary or explanations - just the ready-to-post thread.
